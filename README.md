# Bookstore Database
Bookstore developed for a HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp project utilising Python and SQLite3.

## Project Description
The booktstore database is a useful tool for a online bookstore to manage their inventory of books. The database allows the database owner to view all books in their inventory, add books to the database, update informaiton on existing books and delete books from the database.

## Intallation
1. Install Python on to your local machine.
2. Download the ebookstore.py file from [Github Repo](https://github.com/Shif-28/Bookstore-Database/blob/main/ebookstore.py).
3. Run the code to generate a new database and table.

## How to use
Upon running the code, the program will (if it does not already exist), create a new database and table. The table will be populated with a selection of books already that can be modified.

The user will then be presented with a menu of options. Simply type in the relevant option number and press **Enter** to use that option. Any changes made to the database will automatically be saved.

+ Example of what the menu looks like:
